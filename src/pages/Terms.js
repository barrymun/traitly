              or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any
              kind to
              bind Company in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this
              Agreement, the
              prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All notices under this Agreement
              will be
              in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt
              is
              electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for
              next day
              delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered
              mail,
              return receipt requested. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of [Ireland] without
              regard
              to its conflict of laws provisions. [The parties shall work together in good faith to issue at least one
              mutually agreed upon press release within 90 days of the Effective Date, and Customer otherwise agrees to
              reasonably cooperate with Company to serve as a reference account upon request.]

              9. SERVICE LEVEL TERMS
            </p>
            <p>
              The Services shall be available 99.9%, measured monthly, excluding holidays and weekends and
              scheduled maintenance. If Customer requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime
              calculation
              will exclude periods affected by such maintenance. Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third
              party
              connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Company’s control will also be excluded from any such
              calculation. Company’s blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with its policies
              shall
              not be deemed to be a failure of Company to provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.
